This project is a small React application that allows users to browse a selection of book products, add them to a shopping basket, and manage the basket's contents. The app provides a seamless shopping experience by leveraging React's Context API and the useReducer hook for state management.

## Key Features:

### View Book Products:
Users can browse through a list of available book products, each displaying details like the title, author, price, and cover image.

### Add to Basket
Users can add books to their basket with a single click. Each book added is reflected in the basket, which is accessible from any part of the app.

### Increment Item Count:
In the basket, users can increase the quantity of each book. This is useful for purchasing multiple copies of the same book.

### View Total Price:
The app dynamically calculates and displays the total price of all items in the basket, giving users a clear overview of their potential purchase.
